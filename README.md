# Athenian

Original package was called OHDSIVocab but not re-done as just simple R script

Athena is the name of the dictionary website (and extending it to the OHDSI Vocabulary), the idea
was to have AthenaR - or AthenER. - or belonging to Athens - which inhabitant of Athens is Athenian). So this is the genesis of the name.
